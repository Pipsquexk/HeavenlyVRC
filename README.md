# HeavenlyVRC

This is a mod I made for MelonLoader to be used on the game "VRChat". Heavenly would provide many QoL improvements, as well as some admittedly toxic features. In this mod I completely redesigned VRChat's quick menu, as I had seen no one had quite taken it as far as I thought would be interesting to (as show in the image below).

An update for VRChat's quick menu UI system was pushed shortly after, and absolutely killed a very core feature of this mod (the pretty ui) that many really liked. So I quickly threw in the towl with this as it could no longer be continued on after the massacre VRChat provided.
